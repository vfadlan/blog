title: New Blogsite
---

It’s been a long time since I published my first blog; it was more than 6 months ago. Now here it is, I set up my own blog on a new, completely free platform.

## The Shift

As of November 6th, 2025, the domain name of [fadlanabduh.com](http://fadlanabduh.com) has expired. I didn’t have enough money to renew it, and now it costs me more than $110+ USD for the late renewal fee (fine).

Previously, I used Google Sites + blogspot for all my websites. Now that I don’t have a domain, using them is not that good for SEO.

So, I switched to GitHub Pages for my main web and blogging platform.

## Static Site Generator (SSG)

I use this thing called Hugo SSG, and I use some open-source template for the sake of time. Here’s basically how it works:

1. I set up the site: template, configs, GitHub repo, and pages, etc.
2. Write content in forms of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) inside the content/ directory.
3. Push it to a GitHub Repository.
4. Github Action format every .md (markdown) file inside content/ to some .html
5. Those .html will be accessible via GitHub Pages.

## What’s Coming Next

I don’t know what I’m going to post on this new blogsite that I set up overnight. Maybe this blog is simply just a (rushed) realization of my 2025 goal; it might (or might not) continue. I can only promise one thing from this blogsite: I post more often here compared to other social media (Instagram, Facebook, etc).
