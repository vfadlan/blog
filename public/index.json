Was focused with the C language. The C Programming Language (Second Edition) by Kernighan \u0026amp; Ritchie is my reference and guide book. That book is the \u0026ldquo;Holy Bible\u0026rdquo; of C; it packs all the essential knowledge into less than 300 pages, whereas most technical books take more than 400. Later on, at late November, I also started working with bare-metal AVR.\nThis series documents my journey diving into low-level version of Arduino (ATMega328P).\nBare Metal AVR # What is it? Bare Metal means running software directly on physical computer hardware without an excessive abstraction layer. AVR is a computer architecture for ATmega and ATTiny microcontrollers. The MCU that I use is the ATMega328P, the one used by the Arduino UNO Development Board.\nI simply unplugged that chip from the Arduino Dev Board and ran my code directly on that chip. The ATMega328P can be programmed using a programmer, which is quite of a hurdle to do.\nPict. 1: USBASP Programmer, the one that I use. Pict. 2: ATMega328P 28 pin DIP Pinout. Blue-highlighted text is connected to USBASP pinouts using jumper wires.\nArduino Works Perfectly Fine, Why All These Hurdles? # Well, first things first, the Arduino Development Board is a quick prototyping board that speeds up development. That’s why you’ll never see any device in the big electronic market that uses the Arduino Dev Board. It’s meant for development, not production.\nArduino run upon an Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which is the ATMega328P. There are tons of MCU families out there; STM32, PIC, MSP, Renesas, and AVR are the most commonly used MCUs in the market.\nSecond, it runs faster. By stripping off the Arduino abstractions, we can write a plain C program and flash it to the chip. Here’s a comparison between Arduino .ino code and its C equivalent:\nThe Arduino Code:\nvoid setup() { // setup here } void loop() { // the code that loops forever } C Code:\nint main() { // setup here while (1) { // the code that loops forever } } You see, Arduino is just an abstraction layer. Which is good if you want high portability and fast prototyping. But the abstraction itself is slow in terms of performance.\nIt won\u0026rsquo;t matter if you just blink an LED every one second, but if you\u0026rsquo;re doing something that requires you to have precise timing, even a millisecond matters.\nThose two are my reasons. The third is my motive: to challenge myself.\nRegisters # Just like any other computer, an MCU contains a CPU (Central Processing Unit). Inside it, there’s a small high-speed memory called registers that hold data temporarily during the execution cycle of the program. These registers control how the GPIO, ADC, Timers, and any other peripherals should behave.\nThe structure of each register is usually specified in the corresponding MCU Datasheet or Reference Manual. For example, if we want pin 15 to blink an LED, we have to dive into the datasheet:\nPict 3: ATMega328P 28 pin DIP Pinout. Source: ATMega328P Datasheet.\nPin 15 is identified as PB1. Each pin port has three registers: DDRx, PORTx, and PINx (x can be B, C, or D). Since we just want to output things, we can ignore the PINx register. DDRB: Data Direction B Register\nThis register handles the direction of data. As you can see below, there are 8 bits of data. Each bit corresponds to a single pin (PB0-PB7). Default value is 0, which means it will act as input. Otherwise, it will act as an output. Pict 4: DDRB Register. Source: ATMega328P Datasheet. To set PB1 as an output, we should set bit-1 at the DDRB register as 1. PORTB Data Register\nThe PORTB register handles what signal each pin should send. It can be either HIGH or LOW, 1 or 0. To turn on the LED, simply set 1 to bit-1 at the PORTB register. Pict 5: PORTB Data Register. Source: ATMega328P Datasheet. Bitwise Operators # To handle all these bit-by-bit operations I had to equip myself with the right tool: bit-wise operators. This operator simply gives me bit-wise manipulation techniques:\nClearing a bit on a register REG \u0026amp;= (~(1\u0026lt;\u0026lt;TARGET_BIT)); Setting a bit REG |= (1\u0026lt;\u0026lt;TARGET_BIT); Rotating a bit ROTATED = (REG\u0026lt;\u0026lt;3) | (REG\u0026gt;\u0026gt;(8-3)) Extracting a bit from registers DATA = (REG \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 4) Many other operations Input # There are many ways to receive an input signal. You can receive it from some communication channel, sensor, or a simpler one, like a switch button and a potentiometer.\nFor handling digital input, it’s quite easy. What we do is the opposite of sending an output signal. We read the PORTx register.\nBut an analog signal is slightly more complicated than that. Firstly you have to do the conversion from analog to digital signal. In doing so, there are some registers that you should take care of: DDRx, PORTx, PINx, ADMUX, ADCSRA. And, if you manage to start the ADC process, the MCUs will store the output into two separate registers, ADCL and ADCH. They’re separated because ATMega328P have 10 bits ADC, while a register can only store up to 8 bits.\nFirst Project: Morse Code # I have done some easy things with this low-level stuff. But I wouldn’t call them projects; exercise is the perfect description for that.\nMy first project is to encode a string into visible and audible Morse code (LEDs and buzzer). The code and schematics are available on my repo, see below. You can watch it on YouTube if you want:\nJust like any other system, here\u0026rsquo;s how it works from input, process, to output:\nThe input. My program will accept two digital inputs and one analog input.\nThe analog input is a signal from a potentiometer. It reads the voltage from 0v to 5v. The digital inputs are simply two switches, pull-up and pull-down. It is responsible for telling the MCU when to send the Morse code. The pull-up one will make the CPU send a “Hello World” in Morse code. The other one will send the value of that analog input. The process. Some of the main processes are:\n26 letters of alphabets -\u0026gt; Morse code. It only uses switch case, and call two routines: dot(), dash(). This part is the most bad-looking code in my program, but at least it works. ADC. This process will start right after the pull-down switch is triggered. The output will be stored in an int and converted to a string. Later on, it will be sent to the output. The output. There are two types of Morse code that will be sent by this program:\n“Hello World” The value of that analog input ranges from 0 (represents 0v) to 1023 (represents 5v). For the ‘how’ Morse code is being sent, there are three LEDs (RGB) and a buzzer. Like I said, visible and audible. Each one indicates a different meaning:\nRed LED blinks briefly = dot. Green LED blinks shortly = dash. Blue LED = separation. Separate words or indicate the starting point. Conclusion # The shift from high-level to low-level gives me some kind of reward that I can\u0026rsquo;t explain by mere words. I\u0026rsquo;ll try.\nIt gives me a broader yet deeper picture of how things work on a system. Stripping down the abstractions somehow makes me appreciate more about the everyday device around me. How such a simple thing has been engineered multiple times through trials and errors.\nIn simple terms, I am grateful for abstraction.\nNext interesting things # Thank you for spending your time reading all these yaps. It\u0026rsquo;s an interesting for me to drive a device without the use of external excessive library. Especially for learning things, I\u0026rsquo;d rather write my own driver. Here are things that I might do later:\nDriving LED with Shift Register (74HC595) Driving 7 Segment Display with MAX7219 Driving 8x8 Matrix LED Display with MAX7219 Bit banging the 16x02 LCD to show text Bit banging in rhytm to control WS2812B addressable RGB LED Links # GitHub: 04-potensio-adc ATMega328P Datasheet ","date":"22 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/avr/00-hello/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Hello, Bare Metal AVR.","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"22 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"22 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"It’s been a long time since I published my first blog; it was more than 6 months ago.
