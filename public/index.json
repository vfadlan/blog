I\u0026rsquo;ve been focusing on languages like C; which some might argue isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; low-level, but it feels that way to me. Since late October, I’ve been reading The C Programming Language (Second Edition) by Kernighan \u0026amp; Ritchie. That book is the \u0026ldquo;Holy Bible\u0026rdquo; of C; it packs all the essential knowledge into less than 300 pages, whereas most technical books take more than 400. In late November, I also started working with bare-metal AVR.\nIn this series of blog (yes, you read that right, series), I will share my journey of diving to the low-level version of Arduino.\nBare Metal AVR # What is it? Bare Metal means running software directly on physical computer hardware without an excessive abstraction layer. AVR is a computer architecture for ATmega and ATTiny microcontrollers. The MCU that I use is the ATMega328P, the one from the Arduino UNO Development Board.\nI simply unplugged that chip from the Arduino Dev Board and ran my code directly on that chip. The ATMega328P can be programmed using a programmer, which is a device that uploads machine code to the chip using some cables.\nPict. 1: USBASP Programmer, the one that I use. Pict. 2: ATMega328P 28 pin DIP Pinout. Blue-highlighted text is connected to USBASP pinouts.\nArduino Works Perfectly Fine, Why All These Hurdles? # Well, first things first, the Arduino Development Board is a quick prototyping board that speeds up development. That’s why you’ll never see any device in the big electronic market that uses the Arduino Dev Board. It’s meant for development, not production.\nArduino is based on a Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which is the ATMega328P. There are tons of MCU families out there; STM32, PIC, MSP, Renesas, and AVR are the most commonly used MCUs in the market.\nSecond, it runs faster. By stripping off the Arduino abstractions, we can write a plain C program and flash it to the chip. Here’s a comparison between Arduino .ino code and its C equivalent:\nThe Arduino Code:\nvoid setup() { // setup here } void loop() { // the code that loops forever } C Code:\nint main() { // setup here while (1) { // the code that loops forever } } You see, Arduino is just an abstraction layer. Which is good if you want high portability and fast prototyping. But the abstraction is heavy, which costs you performance.\nIt won\u0026rsquo;t matter if you just blink an LED every one second, but if you\u0026rsquo;re doing something that requires you to have precise timing, even a millisecond matters.\nThose two are my reasons. The third is my motive: to challenge myself.\nRegisters # Just like any other computer, an MCU contains a CPU (Central Processing Unit). Inside it, there’s a small high-speed memory called registers that hold data temporarily during the execution cycle of the program instructions. These registers control how the GPIO, ADC, Timers, and any other peripherals should behave.\nThe structure of each register is usually specified in the corresponding MCU Datasheet or Reference Manual. For example if we want pin 15 to blink an LED we have to dive the datasheet:\nPict 3: ATMega328P 28 pin DIP Pinout. Source: ATMega328P Datasheet.\nPin 15 is identified as PB1. Each pin port have three registers: DDRx, PORTx, and PINx (x can be B, C, or D). Since we just want to output things, we can ignore the PINx register. DDRB: Data Direction B Register\nThis register handles the direction of data. As you can see below, there are 8 bits of data. Each bit correspond to a single pin (PB0-PB7). Default value is 0, which means it will act as input. Otherwise, it will act as an output. Pict 4: DDRB Register. Source: ATMega328P Datasheet. To set PB1 as an output, we should set bit-1 at the DDRB register as 1. PORTB Data Register The PORTB register handles what signal each pin should send. It can be either HIGH or LOW, 1 or 0. To turn on the LED, simply set 1 to bit-1 at the PORTB register. Pict 5: PORTB Data Register. Source: ATMega328P Datasheet. Bitwise Operators # To handle all these bit-by-bit operations you I had to equip myself with the right tool: bit-wise operators. This operators simply gives me bit-wise manipulation technique:\nClearing a bit on a register Setting a bit Rotating a bit Extracting a bit from register Reversing Many other operators Input # There are many ways to recieve an input signal. You can recieve it from some communication channel, sensor, or more simple one like switch button and potentiometer.\nFor handling digital input, it\u0026rsquo;s quite easy. What we do is the opposite of sending an output signal. We read the PORTx register.\nBut analog signal, it\u0026rsquo;s slightly more complicated than that. There are some registers that you should take care of: DDRx, PORTx, PINx, ADMUX, ADCSRA. And, if you manage to start the ADC process, the output will be stored in two separate register, ADCL and ADCH. They\u0026rsquo;re separated because ATMega328P have 10 bits ADC, while a register can only store up to 8 bits.\nFirst Project: Morse Code # I have done some easy thing that I have done with this thing. But I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call them as projects, exercise is the perfect description for that.\nMy first project is to encode a string, into visible and audible morse code (leds and buzzer). You can watch it on YouTube if you want:\nJust like any other system, I would like to tell you how it works from input, process, to output:\nThe input My program will accept two digital input and one analog input.\nThe digital input is simply a switch, pull-up and pull-down. It responsible for telling the MCU, when to send the morse code. The pull-up one, will make the CPU send a \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo; in morse code.\nThe process\nThe output\nConclusion # Next interesting things # ","date":"21 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/00-hello-bare-metal-avr/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Hello, Bare Metal AVR.","type":"posts"},{"content":"It’s been a long time since I published my first blog; it was more than 6 months ago. Now here it is, I set up my own blog on a new, completely free platform.\nThe Shift # As of November 6th, 2025, the domain name of fadlanabduh.com has expired. I didn’t have enough money to renew it, and now it costs me more than $110+ USD for the late renewal fee (fine).\nPreviously, I used Google Sites + blogspot for all my websites. Now that I don’t have a domain, using them is not that good for SEO.\nSo, I switched to GitHub Pages for my main web and blogging platform.\nStatic Site Generator (SSG) # I use this thing called Hugo SSG, and I use some open-source template for the sake of time. Here’s basically how it works:\nI set up the site: template, configs, GitHub repo, and pages, etc. Write content in forms of Markdown inside the content/ directory. Push it to a GitHub Repository. Github Action format every .md (markdown) file inside content/ to some .html Those .html will be accessible via GitHub Pages. What’s Coming Next # I don’t know what I’m going to post on this new blogsite that I set up overnight. Maybe this blog is simply just a (rushed) realization of my 2025 goal; it might (or might not) continue. I can only promise one thing from this blogsite: I post more often here compared to other social media (Instagram, Facebook, etc).\n","date":"21 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/new-blogsite/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"New Blogsite","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"21 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
